name:                ghc-dump-util
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Handy tools for working with @ghc-dump@ dumps.
description:
  @ghc-dump@ is a library, GHC plugin, and set of tools for recording and
  analysing GHC's Core representation. The plugin is compatible with GHC 7.10
  through 8.3, exporting a consistent (albeit somewhat lossy) representation
  across these versions. The AST is encoded as CBOR, which is small and easy to
  deserialise.
  .
  This package provides the AST and compiler plugin. See the @ghc-dump-util@
  package for a useful command-line tool for working with dumps produced by this
  plugin.
