stgin -> lambda -> lambda2 -> ghc/stg -> ghc codegen

requirements:
  - data con information must be preservered: tag, names, type rep

TODO:
  extend lambda to store this info OR use these info from stgbin directly

NOTE:
  data con names are globally unique

  I have to understand how codegen works for data cons.
  All the relevant information needs to be reconstructed and passed to stg/cmm codegen.

TODO:
  top string literals
    - it is static data
    - it is not callable code
    - does not generate PNodes

  data defintions
    - data constructior defintion order specifies the tag value
    - some primpos relies on this convention

  data cons
    - always called saturated
    - returns data constructor pointer
    - does not generate PNodes
