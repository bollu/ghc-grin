approaches:

# via lambda

  lambda lifting
  compile closures to lambda pairs
  generate eval / apply for every function

  ## untyped
  - syntax directed unboxed primitive values
    result: insufficient information, because primitive types are called as code pointers

  - boxed primitive values
    result: it works, but leads to inefficient code

  ## typed
  - type directed unboxed primitive values

# direct stg to grin

  possible tricks:
    - generate top level closures from closures + P nodes with the bound variables

Question:
  - how to extract information if a value is a primitive type or a boxed value?

  TODO:
    done - use resultIsLevPoly
    done - export PrimRep for binders to stg-dump
